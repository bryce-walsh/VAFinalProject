# VAFinalProject

This project is a Visual Analytics Dashboard created by Bryce Walsh, Nikhil Bhatia-Lin, and Charlie Caron for the Visual Analytics course at Tufts University in the Fall of 2020. The project was to build a dashboard to solve one of the mini challenges that were part of the VAST challenge held at the VAST conference in 2019.
